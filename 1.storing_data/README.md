<p>The Web Storage API allows you to store data on the client side. This can be done using two types of storage objects: <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>.<br><br>There's a caveat though, you can only save data as <code>string</code>, this is not the end of the world!<br><br>Through a process called serialisation, we can convert an object, including arrays, into a string. However, we want a very particular string format, enter JSON</p>
<h4>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</h4>
<p>JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. In JavaScript, objects and arrays can be easily converted to JSON strings using <code>JSON.stringify</code>, and JSON strings can be parsed back into JavaScript objects using <code>JSON.parse</code>. As the name suggest, a JSON string that represents an object looks VERY similar to a native JavaScript object.<br><br></p>
<h3>Spread Operator and Preserving Array Contents</h3>
<p>The spread operator (<code>...</code>) in JavaScript allows an iterable, such as an array, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected. This is useful for various purposes, such as copying arrays, merging arrays, or adding new elements to an array while preserving the existing contents.</p>
